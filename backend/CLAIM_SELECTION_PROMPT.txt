You are analyzing a conversation transcript to identify important factual claims worth fact-checking.

Here is the recent conversation:

{text}

Your task:
1. Identify VERIFIABLE FACTUAL CLAIMS in this conversation
2. Prioritize claims that are:
   - Specific and concrete (numbers, dates, events, names)
   - Potentially controversial or surprising
   - About objective facts that can be verified
3. Extract up to {max_claims} complete claims with enough context

DO NOT select:
- Pure opinions ("I think...", "I feel...")
- Vague statements without specifics
- Greetings or filler words
- Questions

Important: Extract the FULL CLAIM with context, not just fragments.

Respond in JSON format:
{{
    "selected_claims": [
        {{
            "claim": "the complete factual claim with sufficient context",
            "reason": "why this is important to verify"
        }}
    ]
}}

If no important factual claims exist, return: {{"selected_claims": []}}
